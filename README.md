# Parallel_Genetic_Algorithm
Final project with Simon Van Der Weide for CPSC 424: Parallel Programming Techniques taught by Dr. Andrew Sherman in Fall 2022.

We implemented a genetic algorithm in C to optimize any function of any number of variables, and improved its performance using OpenMP and MPI.
The report for this project is in the pdf.
